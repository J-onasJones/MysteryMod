# Mystery Mods
The *Mystery Mods* are a mod-family that can be added and removed individually while still keeping the base mod, the **Mystery Mod**.
These mods are all **Fabric/Quilt** compatible mods, there are no plans for a Forge port.

# Mystery Mod
The Mystery Mod is the base mod of the *Mystery Mods*. It is the heart of the Mystery Mod project and and connects all Mystery Mods together. It includes ingame tutorials to all the different mods as well as a structured config screen to all the settings of the different mods. It aims to be the most lightweight mod out of all of the *Mystery Mods* by not having any ingame affects such as new items, mobs or else. Serverside it will only hold the mods together and generate the config files.

#### Ideas and plan
- Config and help button for all mystery mods on main menu
- Custom config menu on button click with options:
	- Change skin
	- Change GUI (button style, menu background (panorama for every gui, start animation on game launch, etc) and presets for button arrangement (bedrock edition, lunar client, badlion client styles))
	- Advanced (small tweaks such as debug screen toggle in menu, etc.
	- Help (pixel art of NatanDerBratan and Jonas_Jones explaining all the mystery mods (similar to Minecraft Live mob reveals), when clicking on button “Help” the buttons for all other mods will appear
	- Mystery RPG Mod config
	- Mystery Dungeons config
	- Mystery Dimensions config

# Credits
These mods have been/ will be coded by me, Jonas_Jones but the project is being realised together with [@NatanDerBratan](https://www.github.com/NatanDerBratan)
Credts to him go for all the textures of the mods and at least 50% of the ideas.
